# spring3-test-dbunit-mybatis
Because The newest version of spring-test-dbunit had not support spring 3.X , so I write  a demo to show the usage of spring-test-dbunit(1.2.1)  on Spring 3.X

I had modified the spring-test-dbunit which base on origin branch 1.2.1,now I had put the modified verion on my github;
the url is:https://github.com/rbsrcy/spring-test-dbunit/tree/1.2.1

I alse change the source of dbunit-2.5.2 to suppert value comparasion skip using a '@SKIP@' flag write on dataset xml.

when I have free time,I will write a full introduction to show how to use spring-test-dbunit on spring 3.X.
